        <h2>A Quick Glance</h2>
        <p>
           <em>I was born</em> on April 9th, 2003 at <em>SAN JOE Hospital, Perumbavoor, Kerala</em>.My Family made up of my <em>father, mother,grand mother and 2 brothers</em> had been living in India for several years.I completed my primary education at <em>st.patricks academy</em>.
            and high school at st.thomas hss malayattoor.After that i migrated to <em>Canada</em> for my higher education at <em>Gergian College, Barrie</em> for the course <em> Computer Programming.</em>
        </p>


        <p>
            I have completed my <em> higher studies</em> with an overall of <em>90%</em> for Bio Maths from st.thomas hss malayattoor.
            I have also studied a seperate course of <em> Java Programming Language</em> while at my home country. During my school days, i usually spent my free time in the <em>Library</em> together with my friends and we keep on researching
            more about computer <em>programming languages</em> since we were intrerested to learn more about <em>Coding.</em>
        </p>


        <p>
            I have taken this course in order to improve my <em>Computer Skills</em> and other than that i can <em>improve</em>  my life standards by getting a good job in a field of my <em>personal interest</em>. <br>I have choosen <em> Canada</em> for my higher education so that i could get to know about <em>another culter of the world</em> and also 
            i came to know that there are a lot of oppurtunities for <em>Computer Programmers</em> at Canada by the way i could get better <em>jobs</em> to get more chances to involve more in the <em>Computer Industry</em>
